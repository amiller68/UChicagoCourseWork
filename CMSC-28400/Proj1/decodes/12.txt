early attempts at almond growing in the united states the first attempts to grow the edible almond in the united states were made in the new england and middle atlantic states very early, but resulted in failure because of the rigors of the climate. a bit later, planting of almond trees received from one of the eastern states was made in california, and later almonds were planted to some extent in nearly all the states along the atlantic seaboard, on the gulf coast, and in the west. most of these plantings came to naught, because, even in mild climates, the early blooming of the almond rendered the blossoms liable to injury from spring frosts, with the result that crops were not secured often enough to be worth while. of all the states, california seemed the best adapted to commercial almond production, but even there it was finally learned that only those sections specially favored with good air drainage and freedom from late spring frosts could be utilized profitably for this purpose. although there have been several periods of serious depression, the industry in california has grown until today the area in bearing and in young nonbearing trees comprises about 10,000 acres, while the annual production during the last few years has been from 1,000 to slightly more than 11,000 tons of almonds in the shell.

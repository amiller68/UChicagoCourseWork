type of farming the first consideration is the type of farming followed, which must be adapted to soil, climatic, and labor conditions, and especially to local conditions with reference to markets and market facilities, as well as to the business conditions existing on the individual farm. profits in farming are greatly affected from year to year by conditions over which the farmer has little or no control. probably the most important, in most regions, are nature of the soil and yearly variations from year to year in weather conditions and prices. there are other conditions which one man alone can not control but which require the cooperation of an entire community for best results, such as maintaining and improving public roads and public schools, or other social, educational, and economic phases of farm development. there is another group of factors affecting farm profits over which the individual farmer may have nearly entire control. from a study of these factors it is usually possible to determine both the good points and the deficiencies in a system of farming, and steps for improvement may be taken accordingly, with some assurance of a better income. on a majority of farms success is primarily dependent upon four important factors: (1) size of business, (2) yield of crops, (3) returns from livestock, (4) efficiency of labor.

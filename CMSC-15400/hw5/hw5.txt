a.
Line 4 in the assembley corresponds to the assignment of the += espression on line 4 of the C code.
It just loads the value stored in *pb to be used to add to arr[i].

b.
Scenario: *pb points to a long in the array arr. The value at (%rsi) needs to be refreshed in every loop in
this scenario because it can change as the loop exexcutes.

c.
Memory Aliasing

d.
In order to achieve the same effect as the re-ordering, you would need to declare some local (to the function)
long var and assign the value stored at pb to it BEFORE the for loop. Then you would use that var in the for
loop instead of *pb:

...
long i;
long some_var = *pb;
for(int i; i < n; i ++){
	arr[i] += some_var;
....
.

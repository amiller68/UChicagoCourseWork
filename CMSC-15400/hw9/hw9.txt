1)
	A. 500 bytes; Each fd is 50 bytes; 100 of them are opened, none of them are closed
	B. 0 bytes; After each child services its client, it exits. This closes its copy of the parent's FD table, and decrements the fd structures refcnt.
	   Therfore, when the parent closes its copy of the FD, the FD strcuture is removed from memory, eliminating memory leaks

	cnt.t0 		N		Y		N	
	cnt.t1 		N		N		Y
	i.m    		Y		Y		Y
	msgs.m		Y		Y		Y
	myid.t0		N		Y		N

	A. T1: (a,b) (a,c) (b,c) (a,d)
	   T2: (d,c) (c,b) (d,b)

	B. Yes, there is overlap. And no, the locks in question ( (c,b) & (b,c) ) are locked in reverse order

	C. Yes. If T1 locks b and T2 locks c before either can release those locks, there will be Deadlock.

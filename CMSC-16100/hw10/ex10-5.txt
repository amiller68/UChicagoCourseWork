the first expression applies (+) to [2], and then (*) to the same value
it repeats this porcess but in effect replaces (+) and (*) with (+2) and (*2)
and then applies the same order of arguments to [3]

the second expression meanwhile applies (+) to 2 and 3, which are they themseleves the
first elements of two arrays of infinite length, each populated with 2 and 3 respectively
The second expression then shifts to the second element in its first argument and applies it to the
second elements in its other two arguments.

The main difference between the two methods is that method one does not shift
its arguemts while method 2 does

If we were to pupulate the lists of intergers we were operating on with more vlaues
we would see different results

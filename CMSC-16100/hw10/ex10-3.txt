There is no applicative for ((,) a) because
while it is a functor, there is no applicative
 purpose for it.
 Meaning that while we could create an Applicative
 instance of ((,) a), there is really no need to
 becuase it is taken care of in other instances.
 EIther that or maybe you just can store functions in applicatives
